- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @levidoughty. I'm currently a student aspiring to be a radiologic technologist. I love technology and have always had an interest in learning how computers work.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a wide variety of subsets of technology, including home automation, chat bots, mobile apps, and web design. I also love free open source software, but I do use a number of proprietary software as well, as I am also a fan of Apple. I don't like to put all my eggs in one basket, so I enjoy dabbling with just about anything relating to tech! Android and Linux are fun too, and I personally enjoy when apps are crossplatform!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning life sciences in college, but I hope to add to my computer science repertoire in the near future! I probably will start off with learning Python and HTML5.
