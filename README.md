- 👋 Hi, I’m @levidoughty. I'm currently a student aspiring to be a radiologic technologist. I love technology and have always had an interest in learning how computers work.
- 👀 I’m interested in a wide variety of subsets of technology, including home automation, chat bots, and web design. I also love free open source software, but I do use a number of proprietary software as well, as I am also a fan of Apple.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning life sciences in college, but I hope to add to my computer science repertoire in the near future!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular at the current time, but I'll be sure to update my profile when the time comes!
- 📫 How to reach me: Email is the best way to reach me: levidoughty@pm.me
- 💬 I'll update my profile in the future with other ways to contact me!
